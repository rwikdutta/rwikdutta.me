<p>Hi, I am Rwik. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Engineering in Computer Science and Technology and am currently working at an early stage startup based out of Bangalore, India where my primary job is to use Deep Learning ( primarily in NLP domain ) to automate business processes in production settings and build custom ETL pipelines according to business needs. I am experienced in customizing and implementing state-of-the-art models in NLP domain for various business needs.</p>

<p>My primary area of interest is in Deep Learning, using its power to solve various real world problems. I am specially interested in seeing the advancements that Natural Language Understanding ( NLU ) has made in recent times and how it can be used to better manage and understand the overwhelming amount of information available today. I am also intrigued about the consequences of widespread implementation of AI and the questions regarding ethics, data privacy and other aspects that arises as a consequence of widespread implementation of AI.</p>

<p>I have previously done research in Computer Vision during my college years which have been published in LNCS ( Lecture Notes in Computer Science ), Springer on Bengali (my native language) Character Classification.</p>

<p>I have also done other projects related to Deep Learning, Web Development and Data Science ( details of which can be found in my resume ).</p>

<p>On the technical front, Python is my language of choice and PyTorch is my go-to choice for Deep Learning Framework. My framework of choice for Web Development is Django.</p>
