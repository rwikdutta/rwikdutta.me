  <li>Internship: Digitizing Identity Documents for a client  Working on digitizing identity cards and documents for
KYC purposes by first using OCR to annotate the documents, use image pre-processing where
necessary and then use both logic and automation ( in some cases ) to extract the information from
those cards in a  Mar ’19 – Present
 Predicting Relevant Articles for Tweets  We show relevant articles (from “trusted” sources) for
tweets. The idea is to give the social media users context for the tweets that they see so that they
might not be influenced by fake news. We scrape the web for articles from trusted sources, preprocess it and when a new tweet arrives, show the most relevant news articles (from our collection of
articles) for that tweet.  Jan ’19 – Present
 Tableau Viz Dashboard - Category Wise Import and Export of Commodities by India 14-15 to 17-18 
Developed an intuitive dashboard using which any one can ingest India’s Export Import Scenario from
F.Y. 14-15 to F.Y. 17-18 along different dimensions - Country Wise, Year Wise, Product Category Wise.
 Nov ’18  Link
 Predict Deforestation from Satellite Imagery  Uses data from NASA’s Landsat 8 satellite via
NASA’s API to predict whether any activity related to deforestation is going on. Training data was
obtained from a Kaggle competition. A Resnet-34 CNN model was used as the model. The model
obtained f2 score of ~0.927.  Aug ’18 – Sep ’18  Link
 Backend (REST Service) for an anonymized (voice masked) audio confession app and user Q and A
app  Backend developed in Django (Python)  Apr ’18-May ’18  Link
 Codevita last 3 years result analysis  Analyses the last 3 years results of TCS Codevita coding
competition  Link
 Exploratory Data Analysis of Consumer Complaints in Brazil  I am working on a dataset consisting of
the consumer complaints for the last 5 years.  Kaggle: Link
