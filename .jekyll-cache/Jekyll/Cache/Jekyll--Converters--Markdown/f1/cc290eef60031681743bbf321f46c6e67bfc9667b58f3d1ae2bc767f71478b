<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Predicting Relevant Articles for Tweets.
    <ul>
      <li>Done as part of college final year project.</li>
      <li>Show relevant articles (from ‚Äútrusted‚Äù sources) for
  tweets. The idea is to give the social media users context for the tweets that they see so that they might not be influenced by fake news. We scrape the web for articles from trusted sources, preprocess it and when a new tweet arrives, show the most relevant news articles (from our collection of articles) for that tweet.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tableau Viz Dashboard - Category Wise Import and Export of Commodities by India 14-15 to 17-18.
    <ul>
      <li>Developed an intuitive dashboard using which any one can ingest India‚Äôs Export Import Scenario from F.Y. 14-15 to F.Y. 17-18 along different dimensions - Country Wise, Year Wise, Product Category Wise.</li>

  <li>Predict Deforestation from Satellite Imagery
    <ul>
      <li>Uses data from NASA‚Äôs Landsat 8 satellite via
NASA‚Äôs API to predict whether any activity related to deforestation is going on. Training data was
obtained from a Kaggle competition. A Resnet-34 CNN model was used as the model.</li>
      <li>The model obtained f2 score of ~0.927.</li>
