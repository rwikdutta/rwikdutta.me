I"å<p>Itâ€™s been almost a year since I started working as a Machine Learning Engineer at an early stage startup. Its been a roller-coaster ride to say the least. And I have learnt so much in that same period. Today, I thought of reflecting on the lessons learnt and to summarise my learning in the blog post. The list is definitely not exhaustive but I have tried to cover the most important ones. Since the list was becoming long, I decided to break it down into two parts. The first part contains some of the lessons which are more specific to applying ML in business scenarios while the second one will contain some lessons which are much more general. Some of them might seem very trivial, but even then, its surprising how often we tend to overlook or take for granted the most trivial steps.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Understand the problem ( business case )</strong>: This is one of the steps which seems very obvious but at the same time, not enough attention is paid to this step.</li>
</ol>
