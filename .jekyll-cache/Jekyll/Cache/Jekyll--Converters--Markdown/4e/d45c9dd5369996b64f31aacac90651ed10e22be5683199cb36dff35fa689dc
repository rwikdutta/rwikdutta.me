ÔÇ∑ Predicting Relevant Articles for Tweets ÔÇ∑ We show relevant articles (from ‚Äútrusted‚Äù sources) for
tweets. The idea is to give the social media users context for the tweets that they see so that they
might not be influenced by fake news. We scrape the web for articles from trusted sources, preprocess it and when a new tweet arrives, show the most relevant news articles (from our collection of
articles) for that tweet. ÔÇ∑ Jan ‚Äô19 ‚Äì Present
